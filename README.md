## Installation
Steps coming soon!

---

## Features (Current)
- Loads and visualizes historical stock price data

---

## Planned Features
- Prepares data for LSTM modeling 
- Trains a TensorFlow LSTM model
- Visualizes actual vs predicted prices

---

## Notes

This project follows a guide from https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/lstm-python-stock-market.

This project modernizes an LSTM stock prediction tutorial originally written for TensorFlow 1.6 by refactoring it to TensorFlow 2.x and Keras APIs. Built using Python 3.10.

Improvements coming soon!
